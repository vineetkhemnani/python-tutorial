- You need to get as close to 21 as possible.
- All cards from 2-10 counts as their face value
- Jack, King and Queen each count as 10
- Ace can be counted as 1 or 11, you can decide which value you want your ace to represent
- If dealer total = your total, its a draw
- If the dealer scores <17, the dealer will draw another card

- **DO NOT USE += TO ADD A SINGLE ITEM TO A LIST**
- **ALWAYS USE .append() if you want to append a single item to a list**
- **USE += AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO extend()**

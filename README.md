## Operators in python
- +,-,*,/
- / => division in float
- // => division in floor (returns floor of division)
- ** => power 
- ```2 ** 3``` => returns 8
- round((expression),place)
for ex:-
```
print(round((8/3),1))
# rounds off ABOVE code to 1 decimal place
print(round((8/3),2))
# rounds off ABOVE code to 2 decimal place
```
## Shorthands
- result=result/2 can be written as result/=2
- also result=result+2 can be written as result+=2
and so on

## Template literals or f-strings(formatted strings)
```
score=0
height=1.2
isWinning=True
print(f"score is {score}, height is {height}, isWinning is {isWinning}")
```
